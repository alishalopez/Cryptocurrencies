# Cryptocurrencies

Through this challenge we learned what unsupervised learning is used for and how to use the data to create visualizations that allow for better understanding.
We will use unsupervised learning for this analysis since our client is unsure of the output she is looking for. We hope to allow for clear visibility for a new cryptocurrency investment after our analysis.
